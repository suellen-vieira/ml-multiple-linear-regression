## Analyzing the Impact of Advertising Channels on Sales Using Multiple Linear Regression

A simple dataset that explores the relationship between advertising expenditures across various channels (TV, radio, and newspaper) and sales performance.

Using this dataset, we apply multiple linear regression analysis using Scikit-Learn to quantify the unique contribution of each advertising channel to sales outcomes. This approach not only helps identify the most effective advertising medium but also provides actionable insights for optimizing marketing budgets.
